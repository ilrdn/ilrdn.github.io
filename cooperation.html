            <h2>CakeBoost presents a brief guide for the optimal class selection for PvP in WoW Classic.</h2>
            <p>Over the years, the mechanics and gameplay in World of Warcraft have undergone significant changes, but PvP has been and remains one of the most popular formats. It is PvP that allows players to measure their strength among themselves and determine the strongest. Due to the continued popularity of PvP in WoW Vanilla (Classic), many players are wondering: which class and specialization are best suited for PvP? First of all, players are interested in characteristics that would ensure the speed of characterâ€™s movement along the PvP Rank ladder, as well as survival and effectiveness in the battle. CakeBoost presents a brief guide for the optimal class selection for PvP in WoW Classic.</p>
            <h3>Honor Points (HP) is an indicator through</h3>
            <p>First we need to say a few words about how the Vanilla PvP system works in general. As part of the implementation of a new (or rather, revived) grandiose project, WoW Vanilla (Classic), PvP system is being implemented in several stages. The first phase does not imply any strict system, so players can freely participate in battles with other players, as well as NPCs, without receiving any penalty. However, this anarchy ends with the launch of the second phase 2. PvP Ranks, honor points, fines and so on are already appearing here. During the third phase of the battle, battlefields will become available (Alterac Valley, Warsong Gulch). The rest of the PvP content, such as the global PvP Quests, will be presented later. Honor Points (HP) is an indicator through which players can compare their achievements against each other. Each kill can be assessed by a different number of points depending on your level and the level of your opponent. Comparison of players among themselves occurs within 1 game server.
